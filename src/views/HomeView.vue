                                Hello There, I am Matthew Jesse Thomas,
                                I'm inspired by the work I've done in Software Development in all its success, and not to mention my unique career path Choice.
                                I saw a recent article on managing Developers in the Software Industry and had to Commence. I've managed to accelerate my Developmental Process in Web & Software Development, which has contributed toward as much as 90% growth in as few as three months time.</p>

                                Its Inspiring to be in the working Industry of Software Development. Success in a Software Development career is Somewhat of a Dream for mine.
                                As an Aspiring Developer in the Industry it Begins Now with me. Thus I've managed to Develop a 'Critical' way of thinking and handling 'Problems' in Web & Software Development, which has contributed towards a much needed sense of Confidence as well as a Mindset shift with a focus towards "Exponential" growth in the Near Future.</p>
